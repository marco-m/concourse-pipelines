= WIP Building a Docker image inline with the pipeline which consumes it

WARNING: This is work in progress!

== Preparation

1. Replace each occurrence of `source: {repository: marcomm/banana-img1}` with your Docker registry/repository.
2. Change the name of the git repositories and git resources accordingly to your project.
3. Set following parameters in your secret store:

```
dockerhub-username
dockerhub-password
```

For example for Vault:

```
export VAULT_ADDR="https://YOUR_VAULT_URL"
vault kv put /concourse/main/dockerhub-username value=MY_USER
vault kv put /concourse/main/dockerhub-password value=MY_PASSWORD
```

== Usage  

This workflow enables to use a feature branch to test the changes to the Docker image(s) before merging to master branch. As such, we assume one master pipeline and one pipeline per feature branch.

* pipeline for master branch: `banana-master`
* pipeline for feature branch `feat-foo`: `banana-feat-foo`

Set the master branch pipeline:

```shell
fly -t vm set-pipeline -p banana-master \
    -c ci/banana-pipeline.yml \
    -v branch=master
```

Set the pipeline specifying the branch name. This can be error-prone, we suggest using a wrapper that validates the current git repository branch name for you.

```shell
fly -t vm set-pipeline -p banana-(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD) \
    -c ci/banana-pipeline.yml \
    -v branch=(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
```

You are set!

Work on the feature branch until the pipeline behaves as expected. When you merge to master branch, in case the Dockerfile has changed, the master pipeline will build a new Docker image.

== Conventions and build-up of images in the Docker registry

Note that this approach will always build one Docker image per feature branch at the moment of creation of the feature branch pipeline. This build can be useless, in the sense that it will happen (but only once!) also if the feature branch will not change at all the Dockerfile.

This also means that the Docker repository will gain one image per feature branch. It will be only one, because the docker-image-resource in the pipeline is configured in aw ay to generate tags of the form

```
((branch))-latest
```

so in case more that one images are built in the lifetime of the same branch, the new one will overwrite the previous one. See also the comments in the pipeline file.

You may want to periodically clean-up the image repository, see section <<Deleting images from a registry>>.

== Deleting images from a registry

According to https://medium.com/@mcvidanagama/cleanup-your-docker-registry-ef0527673e3a

1. Ask for deletion
```
curl -v -X DELETE http://registryhost:reigstryport/v2/${docker_image_name}/manifests/${digest}
```
2. run garbage collector, it seems there are 2 possibilities

*
```
REGISTRY_STORAGE_DELETE_ENABLED=true docker exec registry bin/registry garbage-collect /etc/docker/registry/config.yml
```
*
```
docker system prune
```

== TODO

- explain better the 2 conceptual types of docker images: one that is consumed by the pipeline itself (eg a docker image with the build tools) and one that is the product of the pipeline (eg a docker image that contains the code built by the pipeline). The versioing changes in this case, each product must have its own tag, we cannot overwrite.
- how to use this approach to build and test a concourse resource.
- how to use this approach if the final product of a pipeline is a docker image itself.
- using fly execute with this setup, how to name the images in the task files.
- is there a way to have the master pipeline with embedded image build, the feat branch pipeline without and a separate pipeline only to build the image ? This would reduce the load of resource checking for the secondary git repo for the vast majority of feat branches, that do not need to change the dockerfile. As usual, we would like to do this without any code duplication to avoid sync errors.
